Clone the Repository: First, they need to clone your repository using the command:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Navigate to the Project Folder: After cloning, they should navigate into the project directory:



cd path/to/your-project
Install Dependencies: To install all dependencies listed in package.json, they should run:


npm install
This command will read the package.json file and download all necessary dependencies into the node_modules folder.

Run the Project: After installing the dependencies, they can start the project (for example, in a React app) by running:

npm start
Thus, all dependencies will be installed automatically, and the project will be ready to run.
